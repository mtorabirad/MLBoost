# Welcome to MLBoost!

This repository houses materials associated with the MLBoost YouTube channel, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/@MLBoost. The channel features concise videos, with a duration of approximately five minutes, aimed at presenting the core concepts in a focused manner. By delving into the code provided in this repository subsequent to watching the videos, you can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and gain hands-on experience. I have made an effort to implement the content from scratch, utilizing numpy exclusively, to facilitate a comprehensive grasp of the intricacies involved.


**IMPORTANT**: <br> 
If you have any questions about the contents of this repo, feel free to post it as a video comment or a GitHub issue. I will make sure to reply asap.
