# Welcome to MLBoost!

Materials associated with the MLBoost YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@MLBoost. The channel features concise videos aimed at presenting the core concepts in a focused manner. By delving into the code provided in this repository subsequent to watching the videos, you can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and gain hands-on experience. I have made an effort to implement the content from scratch, utilizing numpy exclusively, to facilitate a comprehensive grasp of the intricacies involved.

# Tags
- TODO
  - At the begining of each notebook add a Table of Content (see the notebook of Episode 8 for an example.).
  - Complete "What you will learn" section for each episode in the ReadMe.
- TORESEARCH
  - Items with this tag are potential research opportunities.


# Table of Contents
- Episode 4: In point forecasting, best possible model may lose to a naive one if ...
- Episode 5: Expected value is optimal under Mean Squared Error metric.
- Episode 6: Median value is optimal under Mean Absolute Error metric.
- Episode 7: Median of an auxiliary variable, with a density different than the target variable, is optimal under MAPE.
